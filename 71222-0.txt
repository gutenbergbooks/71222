The “grandfather” clause of the Arkansas Constitution reads as follows:

“SECTION 4a. No person shall be registered as an elector of this State,
or be allowed to vote in any election held herein, unless he be able
to read and write any section of the Constitution of the State of
Oklahoma; but no person who was on January 1, 1866, or at any time
prior thereto, entitled to vote under any form of government, or who at
that time resided in some foreign nation, and no lineal descendant of
such person, shall be denied the right to register and vote because of
his inability to so read and write sections of such Constitution.

“Precinct election inspectors having in charge the registration of
electors shall enforce the provisions of this section at the time of
registration, provided registration be required. Should registration be
dispensed with the provisions of this section shall be enforced by the
precinct election officers when electors apply for ballots to vote.”

This amendment has been voted upon and the votes canvassed, but an
official count has not been announced, and probably will not be until
just before the general election in November.

The Hon. J. C. Napier will replace the Hon. W. T. Vernon, of Kansas, as
Register of the United States Treasury. The Chattanooga _Times_ gives
the following reasons for the change:

“It appears now that Vernon has outlived his usefulness, since he
could not help the administration to stem the insurgent wave that
recently swept over the Sunflower State, and that his reappointment was
contingent on his success in that campaign. It is learned from that day
he was marked for retirement.

“Tennessee Republican politicians readily recognized the opportunity to
make a master stroke and impression on the Negro vote in Tennessee, by
recognizing one of their race with an important office.

“Napier for eight years was a member of the Republican State Committee,
but the white members fell out with him at the recent state convention
when it was believed that he had agreed to use his influence with the
Negroes in favor of Patterson. Since he was deposed the committee has
been without Negro membership, and this sop is held out to pacify the
rebellious Negroes all over the state.”

Senator Cummins, of Iowa, will introduce a bill into Congress
for direct primaries in selecting candidates for President and
Vice-President. He says:

“To me the injustice is plain of permitting the 4,000 Republicans of
Mississippi to cast 20 votes in the convention, while Iowa, with
300,000 Republicans, can cast only 26. It it right that Georgia, with
only 30,000 Republican voters, should have exactly the same number of
delegates as Iowa, with ten times that number of Republican votes?
Every one recognizes that the Republican party--such as it is in the
far Southern States--is composed almost wholly of Federal officeholders
and those who want Federal office. It has been demonstrated time and
time again that the delegates to Republican national conventions from
these states are absolutely venal and that they uniformly vote with the
administration forces, which purchase them by means of postoffices and
collectorships.”

The Democratic platform in Missouri says:

“The Democratic party when it came into power in 1871, took over the
Lincoln Institute and made it a normal school for the higher education
of the Negro teachers, and it has always made liberal appropriations
for that purpose and for the education of the Negro school children
of the State. It never has and will not discriminate against the
Negro, either by criminal laws or on the question of their rights of
franchise, and it deplores the action of the present chief executive
of this State in seeking to make political capital by creating race
antagonism.”

R. S. Rutledge so resents this plank that he has withdrawn from the
race for nomination as United States Senator.

A press dispatch from Panama says:

“It became known to-day that Mendoza sent a messenger asking
Colonel Goethals to call at the Presidential palace. The army man,
by messenger, asked if he was wished personally or in his official
capacity. Several other notes were passed back and forth, Goethals
finally going.

“When he reached the palace, Mendoza refused to see him. It is said
that the snub was caused by Colonel Goethals drawing the color line in
the first place, Mendoza being a Negro.”

A congress, which promises to be one of the most influential of our
time, is to be held in London July 26-29, 1911, in the central building
of the University of London. The list of those who have extended to it
their moral support is most imposing. Among the supporters, who hail
from no less than fifty countries, are over twenty-five presidents of
Parliaments, the majority of the members of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration and of the delegates to the Second Hague Conference, twelve
British governors and eight British premiers, over forty colonial
bishops, some hundred and thirty professors of international law,
the leading anthropologists and sociologists, the officers and the
majority of the Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and other
distinguished personages. The list of the writers of papers includes
eminent representatives of over twenty civilizations, and every paper
referring to a particular people is prepared by some one of high
standing belonging to it.

particular function, the demands of the union upon each individual
organization is equally great. The work is divided into four general
departments--parents, village improvement, hero and race library. One
or two members from each club is represented in each department.

That powerful Negro empires of great size and some culture existed in
the Sudan before the white races entered Africa is the conviction of a
French scientist, M. Zeltner, who reports in _La Nature_ on the results
of his archæological investigations in the basins of the rivers Niger
and Senegal.

Within a triangle formed by the towns of Timbuctoo, Kayes and Bamako he
located fifty-two archæological deposits consisting of ruins of unknown
cities. M. Zeltner’s most interesting finds were made in caves on the
upper Senegal. Here an abundance of runic signs and drawings were found
traced on rocks. They were similar in character to those discovered
in South African caverns. The writings have some resemblance to those
signs found on ancient ruins further eastward in the Sahara desert, and
are believed by M. Zeltner to be related to the present Tuareg alphabet.

The discoveries made have yet to be thoroughly studied. M. Zeltner
thinks that the archæological exploration of the African continent
is yet in its infancy and will doubtless yield surprising results in

Baltimore is aroused over the fact that the Negroes are buying
property on McCulloh Street. They are proposing to pass an ordinance
which provides that, within a section specified, it shall not be
lawful for any white person to move into or begin to occupy any house
as a residence in any street in which a majority of the bona fide
residents are Negroes; and, on the other hand, that it shall not be
lawful hereafter for any Negro to move into, or begin to occupy, as a
residence, any house in a street in which the majority of bona fide
residents are already white people. There is further provision that
it shall be unlawful hereafter for any person to open, or cause to
be opened, any new streets to be used for residences, without first
declaring in the application for a permit to build whether the houses
are to be built for and occupied by whites or Negroes, and the building
inspector is to issue a permit accordingly.

It is to be noticed that this ordinance does not interfere with any
residence heretofore acquired. The invasion of Negro property owners
is put down as a reason for the failure of Baltimore to grow faster in
population.

others he is more primitive. It says that all earlier human races were
probably colored.

The only thing that makes me afraid is what you call the race problem
here in America. Its a hard thing to contend with. The colored people
should have been educated first, and then gradually emancipated. It was
a mistake to set them free untutored and helpless.--Cardinal Logue in

Probably the new census will show that there are ten millions of
Negroes in the United States to-day; that more than one-tenth of our
total population is colored. Statesmen, educators and economists
realize that this mighty force must be reckoned with soberly; that it
must be guided aright or else the consequences to the nation will be
catastrophic.--_Troy Press._

What is the Democratic oligarchy doing in educating the while masses
in the South to-day? For example, let us investigate the conditions
in Alabama. There were, at the taking of the census of 1900, 731,599
children of from five to twenty years of age, inclusive, in this state.
The total school enrollment in Alabama, as shown in the report of the
department of education for 1906-7, was 386,478.

Of those enrolled, and this does not imply average attendance, there
were 258,998 white children. There were, therefore, 133,618 white
children who did not even so much as enroll, inasmuch as there were
392,616 white children of school age in Alabama in 1900. Of the 338,980
Negro children of school age there was an enrollment of 127,480,
leaving just 111,500 Negro children without the experience of a school
enrollment.--Joseph Manning in the _Original Rights Magazine_.

A colored man said in regard to the Baltimore segregation ordinance:

“This ordinance will keep the colored citizens in the alleys and put
the race back where it was 40 years ago. The streets that have been
conceded to the colored people have been Biddle Street, Druid Hill
Avenue, Etting Street, Division Street and Argyle Avenue. How can you
get 100,000 intelligent colored citizens into this small area?”

Mr. Jacob M. Levy, representing the Socialist party, spoke next, saying
the party protested against any measure that would prohibit a man of
any race or color from changing his environment. He said:

“Believing as we do that the whole human family is one brotherhood,
without distinction of race, color or creed, and that all of them
contribute their share to the sum total of our development and
civilization, we are unalterably opposed to any measure that may
deprive the least of them of the same privileges and opportunities
granted to others. On the face of this ordinance is stamped iniquity,
injustice, hypocrisy and special privilege to the few. Property rights
are placed above human rights. We stand for human rights first.

“Although I own property on Druid Hill Avenue end on Lombard Street,
the former occupied by colored people, I would rather see my property
become absolutely valueless than to see human rights placed below the
interests of property.”

Mr. Charles Kemper, secretary of the Socialist party in Baltimore,
followed Mr. Levy. He declared the ordinance to be ridiculous and said
the whole question was not a racial one, but one of property.

“The colored man has been paid such a low wage that he has for years
been unable to live as well as he wished,” he said. “Now that he has
become able to improve his living conditions, do you propose to prevent
him? The last clause of the ordinance gives the whole measure the lie.
It does not prohibit the buying of property by white or black. Do you
think you can prevent a man from living in the house that belongs to
him?”--_Baltimore Sun_, report of hearings on segregation ordinance.

The concentration of Negroes in back alleys and elsewhere in the choice
residential districts has been the result of innumerable causes,
the poverty following the war, the long years of depression and the
great age of the town, but now that we are engaged in magnificent
public enterprises for the beautification of the city, such as the
construction of the Boulevard, it behooves us to take thought for
the reclamation of entire residential sections. The segregation of
the races is quite as desirable in Charleston as in Baltimore. The
latter fights to prevent the encroachment of the one race on the
other. Our fight should be to correct what is already an evil of long
standing.--_Charleston_ (S. C.) _News and Courier_.

If a Negro went into a white restaurant in our town and sat at a table
and ordered a meal our citizens would want to lynch him, or he would be
arrested and a heavy fine imposed upon him. The same should be done to
a white person that would go into a Negro restaurant and sit at a table
and eat a meal. Last Sunday night while returning home from the depot
after the excursion train left we saw two white men and women sitting
at a table in a Negro restaurant on Suwannee street and eating supper

There was just one thing lacking at yesterday’s session of the
National Negro Business League, when those present were told what was
expected of them if they hoped to do credit to their race and to their
country. A few members of the 25th Infantry in uniform to represent
the dismissed battalion, the fate of which received the attention of
Congress some time ago, would have furnished a welcome touch of color
and reminded the delegates that a grateful nation never forgets. It
would have given point also to the following passage in the address (by
Mr. Roosevelt):

“I am the last man in the world to slur over the injustice that good
Negroes are often subjected to, but I feel that the really substantial
way to remedy that injustice is so to carry yourselves that the white
man will be compelled to recognize in his colored neighbor a good and
honest worker, an effective citizen and a self-respecting man.”

However, judging from the good temper which pervaded the gathering,
and the rapture with which the excellent platitudes were received,
it is clear that a short memory is one of the useful and comfortable

Now I will not venture to say that the Negro is as good as you, for I

as good as I am. You certainly cannot object to my appraising myself;
and I say that the Negro is as good as I am. I also say that I am as

A white man succeeds a Negro as Collector of Internal Revenue for
Georgia. In making this appointment the President follows the policy
announced by him early in March, 1909, when he said that Negroes would
not be named for office “against the wishes of the whites.” In every
Southern State colored men are thus barred as completely as though
citizenship had never been conferred upon them.

In many Northern States the colored vote might easily put it out of the
power of the Republicans to elect Presidents at all. Ohio in particular
is so situated. That the local politicians recognize the value of
the colored contingent is shown by the platform adopted on July 27
last by the Republican State Convention, in which there was the usual
demand for the strict enforcement of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments, with the familiar phrases about equal rights and
opportunities.

There is no uncertainty in these matters except upon one point. We know
that so far as resolutions are concerned the great Republican heart is
still true to the colored man. We know that all Negroes look alike to
the Republican President and that he will have none of them. We are in
doubt only as to the ticket that the Northern black man will vote in
November, especially in Ohio.--_The N. Y. World._

The continued existence of the color prejudice that is peculiar to
the American people is one of the most singular features of our
national life. It is probably due to the lurking consciousness that
the white people of the United States owe a debt to the Negro race
that can never be repaid. None are so unforgiving as those who are
conscious that they have most to be forgiven. It takes more than
common magnanimity to cherish a friendly feeling toward those you have
wronged, and the American people have hardly attained to that point
of magnanimity yet. But we will get there in time, and learn to value
men for their own qualities and not on account of their color or their
pedigree.--_Brooklyn Times._

One of the biggest tasks awaiting the energetic and intelligent action
of the American Socialists is our great Negro problem. It is by no
means disposed of by reference to our theoretical declaration for
human equality regardless of race, creed or color. The problem is
here, a momentous part of the general labor problem. For behind all
the antagonism to the Negro lurks the desire of capitalism to keep
the colored people down in a state of political helplessness so that
they may all the easier be exploited for the benefit of the profit
makers.--_The Call._

It is one thing to govern colored peoples. It is another to live with
them. The States has the harder problem, and the problem is not of its
own making. Until we have a Mr. Roosevelt of our own, we shall not
hasten to advise the States, and we shall be as careful in our censure
as in our advice.

But we must recognize, for it is of primary importance, this new
and violent spirit which is growing in America, under pressure of
the Negroes from within and the yellow races from without. This new
spirit--the result partly of jealousy, partly of contempt, partly of
mere physical repulsion--is crushing, if it has not already crushed,
the religious sentiment of the equality of men. How far will the spirit
spread? There are those who see in it the foreshadow of the great
conflict of the future, when, as they believe, the white races will
fight for their existence against the colored races coming up out of
the East.--_The World_ (England).

that the white race cannot pursue a policy of repression toward the
Negroes without repressing and degrading their own race. They are

inferior race all about them, without being injured by the presence of
this different race, is to lift that race up as opportunity offers, by
the exercise of Christian helpfulness.

The white people of a state which does this are hurting themselves.
Self-government is the thing that educates men to be citizens, and
awakens loyalty to the state or nation. The state that takes away the
rights of half its citizens is turning that half into a group that will
eventually have no loyalty to the state--why should they have? But
education is getting down to all in this land. It will reach these. The
papers come to them and they can think. Some day they will organize
and then there will be what? Rebellion? No, for those who are not
citizens cannot rebel. But there will be clashes, demands of rights,
even by blood. And the state that takes away men’s votes on race lines

The part of him that was Western in his Southwestern origin, Clemens
kept to the end, but he was the most dissouthernized Southerner I
ever knew. No man more perfectly sensed, and more entirely abhorred,
slavery, and no one has ever poured such scorn upon the secondhand,
Walter-Scotticised, pseudo-chivalry of the Southern ideal. He held
himself responsible for the wrong which the white race had done the
black race in slavery, and he explained, in paying the way of a
Negro student through Yale, that he was doing it as his part of the
reparation due from every white man to every black man. He said he had
never seen this student--never wished to see him or know his name; it
was quite enough that he was a Negro.--W. D. Howells on “Mark Twain.”

The _World_ does not discuss the merits of this question, nor do we.
We even agree that many concessions must be made to the prejudices of
mankind, and that it may be true that any action that tends to create
irritation between the races is unwise. But at the same time the Negro
is a citizen, and it seems to us unfair to lay down a general rule
the effect of which is to exclude him from office, without any regard
whatever to his fitness. But the interesting thing about it all is that
this action is that of a Republican President, the President of a party
that has always professed great devotion to the Negro.--_Indianapolis

                              THE CRISIS.

The object of this publication is to set forth those facts and
arguments which show the danger of race prejudice, particularly as
manifested to-day toward colored people. It takes its name from
the fact that the editors believe that this is a critical time in
the history of the advancement of men. Catholicity and tolerance,
reason and forbearance can to-day make the world-old dream of human
brotherhood approach realization; while bigotry and prejudice,
emphasized race consciousness and force can repeat the awful history
of the contact of nations and groups in the past. We strive for this
higher and broader vision of Peace and Good Will.

The policy of THE CRISIS will be simple and well defined:

It will first and foremost be a newspaper: it will record important
happenings and movements in the world which bear on the great problem
of inter-racial relations, and especially those which affect the
Negro-American.

Secondly, it will be a review of opinion and literature, recording
briefly books, articles, and important expressions of opinion in the
white and colored press on the race problem.

Thirdly, it will publish a few short articles.

Finally, its editorial page will stand for the rights of men,
irrespective of color or race, for the highest ideals of American
democracy, and for reasonable but earnest and persistent attempt to
gain these rights and realize these ideals. The magazine will be the
organ of no clique or party and will avoid personal rancor of all
sorts. In the absence of proof to the contrary it will assume honesty
of purpose on the part of all men, North and South, white and black.


                              SEGREGATION.

Some people in Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, Columbus, O., and
other Northern cities are quietly trying to establish separate colored
schools. This is wrong, and should be resisted by black men and white.
Human contact, human acquaintanceship, human sympathy is the great
solvent of human problems. Separate school children by wealth and the
result is class misunderstanding and hatred. Separate them by race and
the result is war. Separate them by color and they grow up without
learning the tremendous truth that it is impossible to judge the mind
of a man by the color of his face. Is there any truth that America
needs to learn more? Back of this demand for the segregation of black
folk in public institutions, or the segregation of Italians, or the
segregation of any class, is almost always a shirking of responsibility
on the part of the public--a desire to put off on somebody else the
work of social uplift, while they themselves enjoy its results. Nobody
pretends to deny that probably three-fourths of the colored children in
the public schools of a great Northern city are below the average of
their fellow students in some respects. They are, however, capable of
improvement, and of rapid improvement. This improvement can be carried
on by the community. The community can, however, if it is cowardly and
selfish, shirk this responsibility and pile it on the shoulders of the
Negroes represented by the one-fourth of Negro children who are above
the average, or equal to it; and they can, if they are persistent,
succeed in pushing back and possibly overwhelming a deserving and
rising class of colored people.

This is the history of color discrimination in general in Philadelphia,
New York and Chicago. When the discrimination comes in various lines
of life, it does not bear simply on those who are not hurt by it--who
do not feel it, and who by their position naturally fall outside the
lines of discrimination, but it comes with crushing weight upon those
other Negroes to whom the reasons for discrimination do not apply in
the slightest respect, and they are thus made to bear a double burden.
Further than this, when the discrimination is once established,
immediately the public provisions for the segregated portion become
worse. If it is discrimination against poor people, then the schools
for the poor people become worse than those for the rich--less well
equipped and less well supervised. If it is discrimination against
colored people, the colored school becomes poor, with less money and
less means of efficiency.

The argument, then, for color discrimination in schools and in public
institutions is an argument against democracy and an attempt to shift
public responsibility from the shoulders of the public to the shoulders
of some class who are unable to defend themselves.


                               BALTIMORE.

An inevitable step forward in anti-Negro prejudice is being taken in
Baltimore, and threatened elsewhere. The colored folk of that city
long ago became dissatisfied with a particularly bad system of alley
homes. They saved their money and purchased nearly the whole length of
Druid Hill avenue--one of the best colored streets in the world. Then
they began to expand into parallel streets, one of which was McCulloh.
They had been told that “money talks,” and that the surest road to
respect in America was financial success. The result was inevitable.
The white people of McCulloh street rose in indignation and are
importuning the City Council to pass an ordinance prohibiting colored
people from “invading” white residential districts, and _vice versa_.
Their argument sounds strong: colored residents bring down the price of
property, therefore get rid of colored residents.

Is this the real logic of the situation? Why do colored people depress
property values? Because of an exaggerated and persistently encouraged
racial prejudice. In the encouragement of such prejudice, Baltimore
and Maryland have particularly sinned. Would not an attempt to allay
prejudice be wiser than laws against thrift?


                                VOTING.

If there is one thing that should be urged upon colored voters
throughout the United States this fall it is independence. No
intelligent man should vote one way simply from habit. Only through
careful scrutiny of candidates and policies can a man put himself in
position to help rule one hundred million people. It is because of
the suspicion that colored men are not capable of doing this, or are
unwilling to do it, that so many American citizens acquiesce in the
nullification of democracy known as disfranchisement. Let every colored
man who can, vote; and whether he vote the Republican or Democratic
or Socialist ticket, let him vote it, not because his father did or
because he is afraid, but because after intelligent consideration he
thinks the success of that ticket best for his people and his country.


                               AGITATION.

Some good friends of the cause we represent fear agitation. They say:
“Do not agitate--do not make a noise; _work_.” They add, “Agitation
is destructive or at best negative--what is wanted is positive
constructive work.”

Such honest critics mistake the function of agitation. A toothache is
agitation. Is a toothache a good thing? No. Is it therefore useless?
No. It is supremely useful, for it tells the body of decay, dyspepsis
and death. Without it the body would suffer unknowingly. It would
think: All is well, when lo! danger lurks.

The same is true of the Social Body. Agitation is a necessary evil to
tell of the ills of the Suffering. Without it many a nation has been
lulled to false security and preened itself with virtues it did not
possess.

The function of this Association is to tell this nation the crying evil
of race prejudice. It is a hard duty but a necessary one--a divine
one. It is Pain; Pain is not good but Pain is necessary. Pain does
not aggravate disease--Disease causes Pain. Agitation does not mean
Aggravation--Aggravation calls for Agitation in order that Remedy may
be found.

Two Italians were lynched in Florida. The Italian Government protested,
but it was found that they were naturalized Americans. The inalienable
right of every free American citizen to be lynched without tiresome
investigation and penalties is one which the families of the lately

   (Extract from speech before the Second National Negro Conference.)


                       WHITE SOLDIERS AT ATHENS.

We cannot perhaps wonder that ordinary citizens make race distinctions
when they are made by the President of the United States. In the autumn
of 1904, at Athens, Ohio, soldiers belonging to the 14th Battery of
Artillery in the regular army attempted to break open the jail in order
to rescue a comrade who had been arrested for some offense. In the
attempt they killed one militiaman and wounded at least two others.
I quote from a letter written by General Grosvenor, the Republican
Congressman from the district, to Mr. Taft, then Secretary of War, thus
summing up the facts:

“Fifty to seventy men marched into the most public street in a village
like this in the early hours of a pleasant summer evening, and without
the slightest provocation, meeting the provost guard, fired from 50 to
75 shots from loaded weapons, killing one, wounding two, and hitting
a citizen, and firing into the corridors and walls of a building, and
yet all this has been obliterated as though the waves of the ocean had
swept through sand. And not only that, but the Government officials--a
representative of the War Department bearing a commission, and a Deputy
United States District Attorney--appeared in the town and manipulated
the preliminary examination of witnesses and boldly denounced the
prosecution. And we are powerless, and the blood of Clark, a fine young
man * * * will go unavenged because of the interference of the United
States through its officials.”

One soldier was sentenced to a year in the penitentiary and another was
fined. There was no other punishment. The action of the War Department
was taken by order of the Acting Secretary, and from the letter written
by Secretary Taft in reply to General Grosvenor, the following extract
is made:

“I should think it doubtful policy on the part of the Government to
direct its officers to defend enlisted men against acts which, as
charged, are certainly offences against the state, unless there is
some ground to presume that the acts are in the discharge of lawful
duties of the enlisted men. The action of the Acting Secretary of War,
however, was based on the helplessness of the men, and the necessity
that no matter how guilty a man is he is entitled to be defended by
counsel. It probably would have been wiser had application been made to
court for the assignment of counsel. Still, an enlisted man is more or
less a ward of the Government, and if the Government steps in merely
to see that he is tried according to law, it seems to me that it is an
exercise of a discretion which the Government has.”

Here the facts were clear, but the guilty men were white.


                     NEGRO SOLDIERS AT BROWNSVILLE.

Two years later it is charged that some soldiers of the 25th Infantry
fired into the town of Brownsville, Texas. No evidence fixing the
guilt upon any one has ever been found, and though investigation has
been had, it remains doubtful whether any of the soldiers, and if so,
who fired the shots. The whole battalion has for years maintained
its innocence. Yet the colored soldiers, each presumably innocent,
were discharged without trial, and the act has since persistently and
violently been defended by its author. Theodore Roosevelt was President
in 1904, as well as in 1906. Why did he not apply the same rule in both
cases? He who from an eminence some distance off saw the colored troops
charge and carry San Juan Hill, knew that they could fight and die
as well as their white comrades. What became of Mr. Taft’s doctrine,
“That no matter how guilty a man is, he is entitled to be defended
by counsel.” Why were the Brownsville soldiers not “wards of the
Government” as well as the soldiers who fired on Athens? The soldiers
of Brownsville were colored.




                               THE BURDEN


                          STEVE GREEN’S STORY.

Steve Green was born in Tennessee in 1862. He has never been to school
a day, and has worked for his living since childhood. He married and
settled in Arkansas, choosing a place where there was good schooling
for his children. What befell him there is told in his own words:

“In 1910 the landlord, Mr. Saddler, raised the rent from $5 an acre
to $9. I and all of the other tenants moved away. Mr. Saddler sent
after me, and said that if I did not work for him I could not work
in Crittenden County. I moved to a place a mile away, but after the
death of my wife started to break up housekeeping. Meantime I hired
out for a day to a neighbor, when Mr. Saddler rode by on his horse.
He said, ‘Green, didn’t I tell you that if you didn’t work on my farm
that there was not room enough in Crittenden County for you and me to
live?’ I said, ‘Yes, sir; you told me so.’ He answered, ‘I meant just
what I said,’ and drew his revolver. I ran, but he shot me in the neck,
left arm and right leg. I kept on running and reached my house, got
my Winchester and shot at him. They say that I killed him. The others
still chased me and I jumped into the river. I stayed in the top of a
tree until midnight. Then I got some cartridges from a colored man and
went to a town some miles away, which took me three nights to walk,
wading in creeks because of the bloodhounds. My friends brought me food
and blankets and I stayed on an island in the Mississippi River three
weeks. Colored friends gave me $32, and I traveled on foot and by rail
to Chicago, arriving August 12. I was betrayed by a colored friend who
told the police. The policeman arrested me, saying that I had stolen
some ties, which I knew nothing about. He took me to the Harrison
street station. For four days they gave me no food or drink. I ate two
boxes of matches trying to kill myself. They kept questioning me about
Arkansas. At last I look sick and they put me in the hospital, where
the doctor told them I was starving, and they gave me something to eat.
Finally Saddler’s nephew came and I was identified, and Sunday night
we left for Arkansas. He said a thousand people were waiting to burn
me. The colored people of Chicago had heard of the story and got out
a writ of habeas corpus. They offered a reward of $100 to the sheriff
who would reach me and telegraphed all along the line to catch me. The
sheriff of Cairo got me just as we were nearing the line. He is the man
who replaced the former sheriff--the one the Governor held responsible
for the mob in that city. I was stopped and sent back to Chicago.”

Steve Green’s friends have engaged lawyers and are fighting his case
for him. The outcome of their efforts to save this unfortunate man will
be recorded in THE CRISIS.


                        THE PINK FRANKLIN CASE.

Pink Franklin, a colored man, was charged with breaking his labor
contract. The labor contract law of South Carolina says that a farm
laborer who leaves his job before the end of the year owing his
employer, is guilty of a criminal offense and may be severely punished.
In the dead of night the constable broke into Pink Franklin’s house,
shot at him and wounded him. Franklin could not see who was shooting
and had no means of knowing that it was an officer of the law. He leapt
from bed and returned the fire, killing the constable.

He was arrested for murder, threatened with lynching and condemned to
be hanged. Two colored lawyers defended him and appealed finally to the
Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court gave no relief
and Pink Franklin still lies under sentence of death. Effort is now
being made to induce the Governor of South Carolina to reprieve him.

She was a well-educated, attractive colored teacher.

“Some people,” she said, “think Charleston to be the prettiest city in
the Southland. The houses are big and cool with lovely gardens. And
then there is a park. You ought to see it! I don’t believe any park
could be prettier.

“I have only seen it once,” she went on. “I did want to visit that
park before I left Charleston, so I asked one of the while Northern
ladies--we were teaching in the same school--if she would take me
there. She was the right kind, and we walked all through it. Of course
every one thought I was her maid. It certainly was a pretty place.”

“But why should the colored people of Charleston,” I asked, “be
deprived of a public place of recreation? Don’t they contribute to the
city by their work and rent and taxes?”

“They certainly do,” she replied, “but that makes no difference. The
park I visited is a white folks’ park. It is very beautiful and so they
keep it to themselves. Do you know,” she added, thoughtfully, “I don’t
believe they would be happy there among the trees and flowers if they
thought people who were poor and black could get in.”

A Chicago schoolboy, claiming that a twenty-five-cent piece had been
stolen from him, accused the only colored boy in the class, who was
suspended. The quarter was subsequently found where the owner had
carelessly placed it and forgotten it, but the teacher made no mention
of this. The colored boy’s mother came to inquire into the matter after
several days and protested against the accusation. “You shouldn’t
mind so much,” said the teacher. “You know it is a common saying that
colored people are dishonest.”

                     The New York Negro as a Tenant

Every Negro resident of New York City prior to the year 1900 remembers
too well the great difficulty always experienced in trying to find
anything like a decent place to live. Never before this time was the
question of “How much rent shall we pay?” anything like as important as
“Where can we live?”

The Negro as a tenant was wanted nowhere except in the very poorest
section of the city and there only in such houses as were so run
down that even the poorest of whites refused to longer occupy them.
In these houses Negroes were crowded together without any regard for
their health or morals. Here they were bullied and even insulted by
independent landlords, who were very careful to do little or nothing
for their erstwhile not wanted tenants except to squeeze from them
every dollar of rent possible.

This was a “condition, not a theory,” that we faced when in October,
1900, we opened our office as the first Negro Real Estate Agents in New
York City, making a specialty of the management of colored tenement
property. Our very best friends all told us that we were attempting
the impossible, that we could not succeed, that we would starve in our
undertaking. For the first year and a half they proved to be prophets
indeed. Our many disappointments, heartaches and actual sufferings
during this period would fill a book and read like a romance. Every one
could tell us how we could NOT make it, but none how we could.

We were real estate agents making a specialty of the management
of colored tenement property for nearly a year before we actually
succeeded in getting a colored tenement to manage. Our first
opportunity occurred in West 134th Street as a result of a dispute
between two landlords. To “get even” one of them turned his house over
to us to fill with colored tenants. We were so very successful in
renting and managing this house that, after a time, we were able to
induce other landlords in whose houses vacancies had occurred due to
the opening of this house for colored people, to make the change and
give us their property to manage.

This was the beginning of the turning over to Negro tenants of one of
the very best sections of Manhattan Island and in no part of the city
are there any better built or more modern tenements for any class of
people than are now occupied by Negroes in this section. By opening
for colored tenants first a house in one block, and then a house in
another, we have finally succeeded in securing for the colored people
of New York over 250 first-class flats and private dwellings in a
fine section of the city, conveniently located as to transportation
facilities, etc.

To this extent our ambition has been gratified. There is, however,
more work to be done in another direction before we shall be entirely
satisfied with the condition of the Negro tenancy in this great
city. We feel that our personal experience both as a Negro tenant
and a landlord has peculiarly fitted us for the work. Dr. Booker T.
Washington in his latest book, “The Negro in Business,” says: “_Mr.
Payton has had an opportunity during this time to learn something
of the condition under which colored tenants live, sometimes are
compelled to live, in New York. Stranger than all else, he was, as he
has confessed to me, several times put out of houses, bag and baggage,
for inability to pay his rent. He has thus been able to see how an
ejectment suit looks from both the point of view of tenant and of
landlord._”

There is every reason why colored tenement property should be managed
by Negro agents. From them, the tenant may be certain of receiving
more real interest, sympathy and respect. Were the Negroes to demand
it to-day, at least 90 per cent. of the colored tenements in this city
could be controlled by agents of their own race. This would not only be
of benefit to the tenant but to the entire race.

Tell your landlord that you prefer to have your rent collected by a
Negro agent. In this manner you will be aiding your people in their
struggle for commercial advancement. You owe it to your race to do this.

Words and phrases in italics are surrounded by underscores, _like
this_; those in bold are surrounded by equal marks, =like this.= One
footnote has multiple anchors; it was moved to the end of the section
in which the anchors occur. Obvious printing errors, such as backwards,
upside down, missing or partially printed letters, were corrected.
Final stops missing at the end of sentences and abbreviations were
added.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
