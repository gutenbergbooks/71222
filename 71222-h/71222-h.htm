<p class="p2 center">POLITICAL.</p>

<p Class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> “grandfather” clause of the Arkansas
Constitution reads as follows:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Section</span> 4a. No person shall be
registered as an elector of this State, or be allowed
to vote in any election held herein, unless
he be able to read and write any section of the
Constitution of the State of Oklahoma; but no
person who was on January 1, 1866, or at any
time prior thereto, entitled to vote under any
form of government, or who at that time resided
in some foreign nation, and no lineal descendant
of such person, shall be denied the right to
register and vote because of his inability to so
read and write sections of such Constitution.</p>

<p>“Precinct election inspectors having in charge
the registration of electors shall enforce the provisions
of this section at the time of registration,
provided registration be required. Should registration
be dispensed with the provisions of this
section shall be enforced by the precinct election
officers when electors apply for ballots to
vote.”</p>

<p>This amendment has been voted upon and the
votes canvassed, but an official count has not been
announced, and probably will not be until just
before the general election in November.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> J. C. Napier will replace the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr>
W. T. Vernon, of Kansas, as Register of the
United States Treasury. The Chattanooga
<cite>Times</cite> gives the following reasons for the change:</p>

<p>“It appears now that Vernon has outlived his
usefulness, since he could not help the administration
to stem the insurgent wave that recently
swept over the Sunflower State, and that his reappointment
was contingent on his success in that
campaign. It is learned from that day he was
marked for retirement.</p>

<p>“Tennessee Republican politicians readily recognized
the opportunity to make a master stroke
and impression on the Negro vote in Tennessee,
by recognizing one of their race with an important
office.</p>

<p>“Napier for eight years was a member of the
Republican State Committee, but the white members
fell out with him at the recent state convention
when it was believed that he had agreed
to use his influence with the Negroes in favor of
Patterson. Since he was deposed the committee
has been without Negro membership, and this sop
is held out to pacify the rebellious Negroes all
over the state.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Senator Cummins, of Iowa, will introduce a
bill into Congress for direct primaries in selecting
candidates for President and Vice-President.
He says:</p>

<p>“To me the injustice is plain of permitting the
4,000 Republicans of Mississippi to cast 20 votes
in the convention, while Iowa, with 300,000 Republicans,
can cast only 26. It it right that
Georgia, with only 30,000 Republican voters,
should have exactly the same number of delegates
as Iowa, with ten times that number of Republican
votes? Every one recognizes that the Republican
party—such as it is in the far Southern
States—is composed almost wholly of Federal
officeholders and those who want Federal office.
It has been demonstrated time and time again
that the delegates to Republican national conventions
from these states are absolutely venal and
that they uniformly vote with the administration
forces, which purchase them by means of postoffices
and collectorships.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The United Colored Democracy of the State
of New York has been organized for the coming
campaign. They demand a colored regiment in
the New York National Guard, and also colored
policemen and firemen.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>J. C. Manning and the Progressive Republicans
in Alabama are fighting Mr. Washington’s political
influence in that state.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The newly elected Governor of South Caroline,
Blease, made his fight on a platform opposing
Negro education and prohibition.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Negroes of South Carolina gained complete
control of the State Republican Convention.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> P. B. S. Pinchback, once Reconstruction
Governor of Louisiana, has been appointed
to the Internal Revenue Service in Cincinnati,
<abbr title="Ohio">O.</abbr></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Colored Independent Political League has
decided to support the Democratic ticket in Ohio,
New York and New Jersey; the Republican
tickets in Delaware and West Virginia, and to
favor Senator Bulkeley, of Connecticut, and oppose
Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts. Local Independent
organizations are at work in New
York, Ohio, New Jersey, Utah and Missouri.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The National Executive Committee of the
Socialist party have appointed Lena Morrell Lewis
and George A. Goebel a committee of two to
investigate the condition of the Negro in America.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Suit has been brought in the United States Circuit
Court to compel the city of Annapolis, <abbr title="Maryland">Md.</abbr>,
to register colored voters. Annapolis by city
ordinance has attempted to nullify the Fifteenth
Amendment.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>The Democratic platform in Missouri says:</p>

<p>“The Democratic party when it came into
power in 1871, took over the Lincoln Institute and
made it a normal school for the higher education
of the Negro teachers, and it has always made
liberal appropriations for that purpose and for the
education of the Negro school children of the
State. It never has and will not discriminate
against the Negro, either by criminal laws or on
the question of their rights of franchise, and it
deplores the action of the present chief executive
of this State in seeking to make political capital
by creating race antagonism.”</p>

<p>R. S. Rutledge so resents this plank that he
has withdrawn from the race for nomination as
United States Senator.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The colored people of Cleveland, <abbr title="Ohio">O.</abbr>, have
received twenty-three appointments to minor offices
to reward their support of Mayor Baehr, who
defeated Tom Johnson. Beside these officials the
colored people have a member of the Legislature
and a member of the City Council.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Negroes of Atlanta prepared an elaborate
program on the occasion of Theodore Roosevelt’s
speech to them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Republicans have nominated Thomas
Briar, a colored man, to run for Congress in the
Fourth District of South Carolina.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the twelve counties of the Eighth Congressional
District of Georgia there were only
392 colored men registered as voters. Even
these, however, very nearly held the balance of
power in the last Congressional election.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A press dispatch from Panama says:</p>

<p>“It became known to-day that Mendoza sent
a messenger asking Colonel Goethals to call at
the Presidential palace. The army man, by messenger,
asked if he was wished personally or in
his official capacity. Several other notes were
passed back and forth, Goethals finally going.</p>

<p>“When he reached the palace, Mendoza refused
to see him. It is said that the snub was
caused by Colonel Goethals drawing the color
line in the first place, Mendoza being a Negro.”</p>

EDUCATION.<br>
</p>

<p>Miss Alice Byington has left Hampton Institute
$260,750.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>New Orleans has four Negro schools with white
teachers and ten with Negro teachers. It has
been decided to place Negro teachers in the new
Thomy Lafon School Annex.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Tuskegee has received about $400,000 from
the Dolger bequest.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A Negro industrial school is talked of in
Pueblo, <abbr title="Colorado">Col.</abbr></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>White Sawyer, a Missouri Negro, has lost
the suit in which he attempted to compel the
school trustees to transport his children. There
is only one colored school in his township and
that is six miles from his home.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An industrial school is to be founded in
Nicodemus, Kansas, a colored colony planted at
the time of the exodus.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A. B. Johnson, of Mississippi, states that in his
own county with less than 7,000 Negroes of school
age over 5,000 have never been to school.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Effort is being made in Washington, D. C.,
to remove R. C. Bruce, the colored superintendent,
for alleged incompetency.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In a talk to white Atlanta ministers a colored
preacher asked that influence be used to improve
public school facilities for the Negroes. He said
the Negro school children of Atlanta number
10,000 and he declared 5,081 of the number are
out of school. “The Negroes of this city pay
$10,000 for education of their children,” he
stated, “that the whites get free.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The city of Chattanooga has refused to take
steps toward establishing a Negro normal school.
It is much needed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>H. T. Kealing, formerly editor of the <cite>African
M. E. Review</cite>, has been elected president of
Western University, at Quindaro, Kansas.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There are a large number of applicants for the
position of president of the Kentucky Normal and
Industrial Institute at Frankfort.</p>

<p>The colored Baptist Women’s Convention has

for Girls in the District of Columbia.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Negroes of Georgia have raised $25,000
as a memorial offering at the quarterly centennial
of Morris Brown College.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The white boys of the Doolittle Public School
of Chicago have tried to get rid of the Negro
pupils. The result has been a good deal of
fighting.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="p2 center">THE CHURCH.<br></p>

<p>A colored institute in memory of Bishop
Dudley has been dedicated at Louisville, <abbr title="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The convention of the Episcopal Church has
authorized suffragan bishops. This will allow the
segregation of colored people under bishops who
will act as assistants to the regular bishops and
have no vote in the convention. The colored
people asked for missionary bishops who would
vote in the convention. Such bishops are to be
permitted only in case the bishop and convention
consent.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is considerable interest in Southern
white churches over missionary and educational
work among Negroes. The subject was discussed
at a recent Bible institute in the University of
Tennessee and the Atlanta <cite>Constitution</cite> has had
several editorials.</p>

<hr class="tb">

Zion Church is dead.</p>

<p>That powerful Negro empires of great size and

in the basins of the rivers Niger and Senegal.</p>

<p>Within a triangle formed by the towns
of Timbuctoo, Kayes and Bamako he located
fifty-two archæological deposits consisting
of ruins of unknown cities. M. Zeltner’s
most interesting finds were made in caves on the
upper Senegal. Here an abundance of runic
signs and drawings were found traced on rocks.
They were similar in character to those discovered
in South African caverns. The writings have
some resemblance to those signs found on ancient
ruins further eastward in the Sahara desert, and
are believed by M. Zeltner to be related to the
present Tuareg alphabet.</p>

<p>The discoveries made have yet to be thoroughly
studied. M. Zeltner thinks that the archæological

<p>Baltimore is aroused over the fact that the
Negroes are buying property on McCulloh
Street. They are proposing to pass an ordinance
which provides that, within a section specified, it
shall not be lawful for any white person to move
into or begin to occupy any house as a residence
in any street in which a majority of the bona fide
residents are Negroes; and, on the other hand,
that it shall not be lawful hereafter for any
Negro to move into, or begin to occupy, as a
residence, any house in a street in which the
majority of bona fide residents are already white
people. There is further provision that it shall be
unlawful hereafter for any person to open, or
cause to be opened, any new streets to be used
for residences, without first declaring in the application
for a permit to build whether the houses
are to be built for and occupied by whites or
Negroes, and the building inspector is to issue a
permit accordingly.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that this ordinance does not
interfere with any residence heretofore acquired.

down as a reason for the failure of Baltimore to

<p>Probably the new census will show that there

<p>What is the Democratic oligarchy doing in
educating the while masses in the South to-day?
For example, let us investigate the conditions in
Alabama. There were, at the taking of the
census of 1900, 731,599 children of from five
to twenty years of age, inclusive, in this state.
The total school enrollment in Alabama, as
shown in the report of the department of education
for 1906-7, was 386,478.</p>

<p>Of those enrolled, and this does not imply
average attendance, there were 258,998 white
children. There were, therefore, 133,618 white
children who did not even so much as enroll,
inasmuch as there were 392,616 white children
of school age in Alabama in 1900. Of the
338,980 Negro children of school age there was
an enrollment of 127,480, leaving just 111,500
Negro children without the experience of a
school enrollment.—Joseph Manning in the

<p>A colored man said in regard to the Baltimore
segregation ordinance:</p>

<p>“This ordinance will keep the colored citizens
in the alleys and put the race back where it was
40 years ago. The streets that have been conceded
to the colored people have been Biddle
Street, Druid Hill Avenue, Etting Street,
Division Street and Argyle Avenue. How can
you get 100,000 intelligent colored citizens into
this small area?”</p>

<p>Mr. Jacob M. Levy, representing the Socialist
party, spoke next, saying the party protested
against any measure that would prohibit a man
of any race or color from changing his environment.
He said:</p>

<p>“Believing as we do that the whole human
family is one brotherhood, without distinction of
race, color or creed, and that all of them contribute
their share to the sum total of our
development and civilization, we are unalterably
opposed to any measure that may deprive the
least of them of the same privileges and opportunities
granted to others. On the face of this
ordinance is stamped iniquity, injustice, hypocrisy
and special privilege to the few. Property rights
are placed above human rights. We stand for
human rights first.</p>

<p>“Although I own property on Druid Hill
Avenue end on Lombard Street, the former occupied
by colored people, I would rather see my
property become absolutely valueless than to see
human rights placed below the interests of property.”</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Kemper, secretary of the Socialist
party in Baltimore, followed Mr. Levy. He
declared the ordinance to be ridiculous and said
the whole question was not a racial one, but one
of property.</p>

<p>“The colored man has been paid such a low
wage that he has for years been unable to live
as well as he wished,” he said. “Now that he
has become able to improve his living conditions,
do you propose to prevent him? The last clause
of the ordinance gives the whole measure the lie.
It does not prohibit the buying of property by
white or black. Do you think you can prevent a
man from living in the house that belongs to
him?”—<cite>Baltimore Sun</cite>, report of hearings on
segregation ordinance.</p>

<p>The concentration of Negroes in back alleys

poverty following the war, the long years of
depression and the great age of the town, but
now that we are engaged in magnificent public
enterprises for the beautification of the city,
such as the construction of the Boulevard, it
behooves us to take thought for the reclamation
of entire residential sections. The segregation
of the races is quite as desirable in Charleston
as in Baltimore. The latter fights to prevent the
encroachment of the one race on the other. Our
fight should be to correct what is already an evil
of long standing.—<cite>Charleston</cite> (<abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>) <cite>News and

<p>If a Negro went into a white restaurant in

our citizens would want to lynch him, or he
would be arrested and a heavy fine imposed upon

person that would go into a Negro restaurant
and sit at a table and eat a meal. Last Sunday
night while returning home from the depot
after the excursion train left we saw two
white men and women sitting at a table in a
Negro restaurant on Suwannee street and eating

<p>There was just one thing lacking at yesterday’s
session of the National Negro Business
League, when those present were told what
was expected of them if they hoped to do
credit to their race and to their country. A
few members of the 25th Infantry in uniform
to represent the dismissed battalion, the fate
of which received the attention of Congress
some time ago, would have furnished a welcome
touch of color and reminded the delegates
that a grateful nation never forgets. It would
have given point also to the following passage
in the address (by Mr. Roosevelt):</p>

<p>“I am the last man in the world to slur over
the injustice that good Negroes are often subjected
to, but I feel that the really substantial
way to remedy that injustice is so to carry
yourselves that the white man will be compelled
to recognize in his colored neighbor a good and
honest worker, an effective citizen and a self-respecting
man.”</p>

<p>However, judging from the good temper which
pervaded the gathering, and the rapture with
which the excellent platitudes were received, it
is clear that a short memory is one of the useful
and comfortable endowments of the Negro
race.—<cite><abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr> Sun.</cite></p>

<p>“I gather from your article in the June

<p>A white man succeeds a Negro as Collector
of Internal Revenue for Georgia. In making
this appointment the President follows the policy
announced by him early in March, 1909, when
he said that Negroes would not be named for
office “against the wishes of the whites.” In
every Southern State colored men are thus barred
as completely as though citizenship had never
been conferred upon them.</p>

<p>In many Northern States the colored vote
might easily put it out of the power of the Republicans
to elect Presidents at all. Ohio in
particular is so situated. That the local politicians
recognize the value of the colored contingent
is shown by the platform adopted on July
27 last by the Republican State Convention,
in which there was the usual demand for the
strict enforcement of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth
and Fifteenth Amendments, with the familiar
phrases about equal rights and opportunities.</p>

<p>There is no uncertainty in these matters except
upon one point. We know that so far as
resolutions are concerned the great Republican
heart is still true to the colored man. We know
that all Negroes look alike to the Republican
President and that he will have none of them.

<hr class="tb">

<p>The continued existence of the color prejudice
that is peculiar to the American people is one
of the most singular features of our national life.
It is probably due to the lurking consciousness
that the white people of the United States owe
a debt to the Negro race that can never be
repaid. None are so unforgiving as those who
are conscious that they have most to be forgiven.
It takes more than common magnanimity to
cherish a friendly feeling toward those you
have wronged, and the American people have
hardly attained to that point of magnanimity
yet. But we will get there in time, and learn to
value men for their own qualities and not on
account of their color or their pedigree.—<cite>Brooklyn
Times.</cite></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The recent heated political debates between
leading white men of Georgia has for the time
being suspended. Party rules based upon race
lines will compel contestants to submit to the decision
of a vote in the primary that is only partisan
to the extent of being anti-Negro. No
candidate, whatever his personal feeling toward
his colored fellow citizens, has dared to put in
a word favorable to them. * * * Taxation
without representation was oppressive when the
American Colonies declared their purpose to be
independent of the English crown, and it is no
less so when practiced by the descendants of
the men who gave it out to the world. Consider
this matter soberly and wisely and then
act.—<cite>Georgia Baptist</cite> (colored.)</p>

<p>One of the biggest tasks awaiting the energetic
and intelligent action of the American Socialists
is our great Negro problem. It is by no means
disposed of by reference to our theoretical declaration
for human equality regardless of race,
creed or color. The problem is here, a momentous
part of the general labor problem. For
behind all the antagonism to the Negro lurks
the desire of capitalism to keep the colored people
down in a state of political helplessness so
that they may all the easier be exploited for the
benefit of the profit makers.—<cite>The Call.</cite></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is one thing to govern colored peoples. It
is another to live with them. The States has
the harder problem, and the problem is not of
its own making. Until we have a Mr. Roosevelt
of our own, we shall not hasten to advise
the States, and we shall be as careful in our
censure as in our advice.</p>

<p>But we must recognize, for it is of primary
importance, this new and violent spirit which is
growing in America, under pressure of the
Negroes from within and the yellow races from
without. This new spirit—the result partly of
jealousy, partly of contempt, partly of mere
physical repulsion—is crushing, if it has not
already crushed, the religious sentiment of the
equality of men. How far will the spirit spread?
There are those who see in it the foreshadow
of the great conflict of the future, when, as
they believe, the white races will fight for their
existence against the colored races coming up
out of the East.—<cite>The World</cite> (England).</p>

<p>As is well known in South Carolina, the district
funds are not divided among the schools of
the district in proportion to enrollment, but every
Negro child counts as much as a white child
in securing funds for the district. The Negro
schools afford the best opportunity for padding
the rolls. In fact, a contract with Negro teachers
is not infrequently made in South Carolina
in which the salary to be received by the teacher
is dependent on the number of children enrolled.—State
Supervisor of Rural Schools in the

<hr class="tb">

<p>Christian people, in general, at the South,
are coming to recognize that the white race
cannot pursue a policy of repression toward the
Negroes without repressing and degrading their
own race. They are coming to realize that the
only way for the whites to live with an inferior
race all about them, without being injured by the
presence of this different race, is to lift that
race up as opportunity offers, by the exercise of
Christian helpfulness.</p>

and desire for skilful pursuits, and that
many individuals have made great personal advancement.
To what extent such conditions
have been developed and what future hope there
is for the Negro in heretofore barred fields will
be made subjects for future inquiry and report
in next year’s volume.—<cite>Annual Report of Pennsylvania

<p>The <cite>Times</cite> would be astonished if it could
only know the division of sentiment among
Negroes of this State. Hundreds and hundreds
of Negroes “buck” at the lily white Republican
ticket, and they have been waiting to see
what the regular Democrats would do on October
6, and should the Democrats put out an acceptable
and in the least conservative man you will
see a larger division of the Negro vote in the
State of Tennessee than ever before. Not all
the Negroes now can be led into the shambles
by the ever-alluring “slush funds.”—Colored
correspondent in <cite>Chattanooga Times</cite>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The white people of a state which does
this are hurting themselves. Self-government
is the thing that educates men to be citizens,
and awakens loyalty to the state or nation.
The state that takes away the rights of half its
citizens is turning that half into a group that will
eventually have no loyalty to the state—why
should they have? But education is getting
down to all in this land. It will reach these.
The papers come to them and they can think.
Some day they will organize and then there will
be what? Rebellion? No, for those who are
not citizens cannot rebel. But there will be
clashes, demands of rights, even by blood.
And the state that takes away men’s votes on
race lines deserves all the consequences of race
hatred this will inevitably bring.—<cite>Christian

<p>The part of him that was Western in his
Southwestern origin, Clemens kept to the end,
but he was the most dissouthernized Southerner
I ever knew. No man more perfectly sensed,
and more entirely abhorred, slavery, and no
one has ever poured such scorn upon the secondhand,
Walter-Scotticised, pseudo-chivalry of the
Southern ideal. He held himself responsible for
the wrong which the white race had done the
black race in slavery, and he explained, in paying
the way of a Negro student through Yale,
that he was doing it as his part of the reparation
due from every white man to every black man.
He said he had never seen this student—never
wished to see him or know his name; it was
quite enough that he was a Negro.—W. D.
Howells on “Mark Twain.”</p>

<p>The <cite>World</cite> does not discuss the merits of this
question, nor do we. We even agree that many
concessions must be made to the prejudices of
mankind, and that it may be true that any
action that tends to create irritation between the
races is unwise. But at the same time the Negro
is a citizen, and it seems to us unfair to lay
down a general rule the effect of which is to
exclude him from office, without any regard
whatever to his fitness. But the interesting thing
about it all is that this action is that of a Republican
President, the President of a party that
has always professed great devotion to the Negro.—<cite>Indianapolis

<p class="p2 center">THE CRISIS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> object of this publication is to
set forth those facts and arguments
which show the danger of race
prejudice, particularly as manifested to-day
toward colored people. It takes its name
from the fact that the editors believe that
this is a critical time in the history of the
advancement of men. Catholicity and tolerance,
reason and forbearance can to-day
make the world-old dream of human brotherhood
approach realization; while bigotry
and prejudice, emphasized race consciousness
and force can repeat the awful history
of the contact of nations and groups
in the past. We strive for this higher and
broader vision of Peace and Good Will.</p>

<p>The policy of <span class="smcap">The Crisis</span> will be
simple and well defined:</p>

<p>It will first and foremost be a newspaper:
it will record important happenings
and movements in the world which bear
on the great problem of inter-racial relations,
and especially those which affect the
Negro-American.</p>

<p>Secondly, it will be a review of opinion
and literature, recording briefly books, articles,
and important expressions of opinion
in the white and colored press on the race
problem.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it will publish a few short
articles.</p>

<p>Finally, its editorial page will stand for
the rights of men, irrespective of color or
race, for the highest ideals of American
democracy, and for reasonable but earnest
and persistent attempt to gain these rights
and realize these ideals. The magazine
will be the organ of no clique or party
and will avoid personal rancor of all sorts.
In the absence of proof to the contrary it
will assume honesty of purpose on the part
of all men, North and South, white and
black.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="p2 center">SEGREGATION.</p>

<p>Some people in Chicago, Philadelphia,
Atlantic City, Columbus, <abbr title="Ohio">O.</abbr>, and other
Northern cities are quietly trying to establish
separate colored schools. This is
wrong, and should be resisted by black
men and white. Human contact, human
acquaintanceship, human sympathy is the
great solvent of human problems. Separate
school children by wealth and the result
is class misunderstanding and hatred.
Separate them by race and the result is
war. Separate them by color and they
grow up without learning the tremendous
truth that it is impossible to judge the
mind of a man by the color of his face.
Is there any truth that America needs to
learn more? Back of this demand for
the segregation of black folk in public institutions,
or the segregation of Italians,
or the segregation of any class, is almost
always a shirking of responsibility on the
part of the public—a desire to put off on
somebody else the work of social uplift,
while they themselves enjoy its results.
Nobody pretends to deny that probably
three-fourths of the colored children in the
public schools of a great Northern city are
below the average of their fellow students
in some respects. They are, however,
capable of improvement, and of rapid improvement.
This improvement can be carried
on by the community. The community
can, however, if it is cowardly and
selfish, shirk this responsibility and pile it
on the shoulders of the Negroes represented
by the one-fourth of Negro children who
are above the average, or equal to it; and
they can, if they are persistent, succeed in
pushing back and possibly overwhelming a
deserving and rising class of colored
people.</p>

<p>This is the history of color discrimination
in general in Philadelphia, New York
and Chicago. When the discrimination
comes in various lines of life, it does not
bear simply on those who are not hurt by
it—who do not feel it, and who by their
position naturally fall outside the lines of
discrimination, but it comes with crushing
weight upon those other Negroes to whom
the reasons for discrimination do not apply
in the slightest respect, and they are thus
made to bear a double burden. Further
than this, when the discrimination is once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
established, immediately the public provisions
for the segregated portion become
worse. If it is discrimination against poor
people, then the schools for the poor people
become worse than those for the rich—less
well equipped and less well supervised.
If it is discrimination against colored people,
the colored school becomes poor, with
less money and less means of efficiency.</p>

<p>The argument, then, for color discrimination
in schools and in public institutions
is an argument against democracy and an
attempt to shift public responsibility from
the shoulders of the public to the shoulders
of some class who are unable to defend
themselves.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="p2 center">BALTIMORE.</p>

<p>An inevitable step forward in anti-Negro
prejudice is being taken in Baltimore,
and threatened elsewhere. The
colored folk of that city long ago became
dissatisfied with a particularly bad system
of alley homes. They saved their money
and purchased nearly the whole length of
Druid Hill avenue—one of the best colored
streets in the world. Then they began
to expand into parallel streets, one of
which was McCulloh. They had been
told that “money talks,” and that the
surest road to respect in America was
financial success. The result was inevitable.
The white people of McCulloh
street rose in indignation and are importuning
the City Council to pass an ordinance
prohibiting colored people from “invading”
white residential districts, and <i>vice
versa</i>. Their argument sounds strong:
colored residents bring down the price of
property, therefore get rid of colored residents.</p>

<p>Is this the real logic of the situation?
Why do colored people depress property
values? Because of an exaggerated and
persistently encouraged racial prejudice.
In the encouragement of such prejudice,
Baltimore and Maryland have particularly
sinned. Would not an attempt to allay
prejudice be wiser than laws against thrift?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="p2 center">VOTING.</p>

<p>If there is one thing that should be
urged upon colored voters throughout the
United States this fall it is independence.
No intelligent man should vote one way
simply from habit. Only through careful
scrutiny of candidates and policies can
a man put himself in position to help rule
one hundred million people. It is because
of the suspicion that colored men are not
capable of doing this, or are unwilling to
do it, that so many American citizens
acquiesce in the nullification of democracy
known as disfranchisement. Let every
colored man who can, vote; and whether
he vote the Republican or Democratic or
Socialist ticket, let him vote it, not because
his father did or because he is afraid, but
because after intelligent consideration he
thinks the success of that ticket best for
his people and his country.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="p2 center">AGITATION.</p>

<p>Some good friends of the cause we
represent fear agitation. They say: “Do
not agitate—do not make a noise; <em>work</em>.”
They add, “Agitation is destructive or at
best negative—what is wanted is positive
constructive work.”</p>

<p>Such honest critics mistake the function
of agitation. A toothache is agitation.
Is a toothache a good thing? No. Is
it therefore useless? No. It is supremely
useful, for it tells the body of decay, dyspepsis
and death. Without it the body
would suffer unknowingly. It would
think: All is well, when lo! danger
lurks.</p>

<p>The same is true of the Social Body.
Agitation is a necessary evil to tell of the
ills of the Suffering. Without it many
a nation has been lulled to false security
and preened itself with virtues it did not
possess.</p>

<p>The function of this Association is to
tell this nation the crying evil of race
prejudice. It is a hard duty but a necessary
one—a divine one. It is Pain; Pain
is not good but Pain is necessary. Pain
does not aggravate disease—Disease
causes Pain. Agitation does not mean
Aggravation—Aggravation calls for Agitation
in order that Remedy may be
found.</p>

<p>Two Italians were lynched in Florida.
The Italian Government protested, but it
was found that they were naturalized
Americans. The inalienable right of
every free American citizen to be lynched
without tiresome investigation and penalties
is one which the families of the lately
deceased doubtless deeply appreciate.</p>

<p class="p2 center muchsmaller">(Extract from speech before the Second National Negro Conference.)</p>

<p class="center">WHITE SOLDIERS AT ATHENS.</p>

<p>We cannot perhaps wonder that ordinary citizens
make race distinctions when they are made
by the President of the United States. In the
autumn of 1904, at Athens, Ohio, soldiers belonging
to the 14th Battery of Artillery in the
regular army attempted to break open the jail
in order to rescue a comrade who had been
arrested for some offense. In the attempt they
killed one militiaman and wounded at least two
others. I quote from a letter written by General
Grosvenor, the Republican Congressman from the
district, to Mr. Taft, then Secretary of War, thus
summing up the facts:</p>

<p>“Fifty to seventy men marched into the most
public street in a village like this in the early
hours of a pleasant summer evening, and without
the slightest provocation, meeting the provost
guard, fired from 50 to 75 shots from loaded
weapons, killing one, wounding two, and hitting
a citizen, and firing into the corridors and walls
of a building, and yet all this has been obliterated
as though the waves of the ocean had swept
through sand. And not only that, but the Government
officials—a representative of the War
Department bearing a commission, and a Deputy
United States District Attorney—appeared in the
town and manipulated the preliminary examination
of witnesses and boldly denounced the prosecution.
And we are powerless, and the blood of
Clark, a fine young man * * * will go unavenged
because of the interference of the United
States through its officials.”</p>

<p>One soldier was sentenced to a year in the
penitentiary and another was fined. There was
no other punishment. The action of the War
Department was taken by order of the Acting
Secretary, and from the letter written by Secretary
Taft in reply to General Grosvenor, the
following extract is made:</p>

<p>“I should think it doubtful policy on the part
of the Government to direct its officers to defend
enlisted men against acts which, as charged, are
certainly offences against the state, unless there
is some ground to presume that the acts are in
the discharge of lawful duties of the enlisted
men. The action of the Acting Secretary of
War, however, was based on the helplessness of
the men, and the necessity that no matter how
guilty a man is he is entitled to be defended by
counsel. It probably would have been wiser had
application been made to court for the assignment
of counsel. Still, an enlisted man is more
or less a ward of the Government, and if the
Government steps in merely to see that he is tried
according to law, it seems to me that it is an
exercise of a discretion which the Government
has.”</p>

<p>Here the facts were clear, but the guilty men
were white.</p>

<p class="p2 center">NEGRO SOLDIERS AT BROWNSVILLE.</p>

<p>Two years later it is charged that some soldiers
of the 25th Infantry fired into the town of
Brownsville, Texas. No evidence fixing the guilt
upon any one has ever been found, and though
investigation has been had, it remains doubtful
whether any of the soldiers, and if so, who
fired the shots. The whole battalion has for
years maintained its innocence. Yet the colored
soldiers, each presumably innocent, were discharged
without trial, and the act has since
persistently and violently been defended by its
author. Theodore Roosevelt was President in
1904, as well as in 1906. Why did he not
apply the same rule in both cases? He who
from an eminence some distance off saw the
colored troops charge and carry San Juan Hill,
knew that they could fight and die as well as
their white comrades. What became of Mr.
Taft’s doctrine, “That no matter how guilty a
man is, he is entitled to be defended by counsel.”
Why were the Brownsville soldiers not
“wards of the Government” as well as the soldiers
who fired on Athens? The soldiers of
Brownsville were colored.</p>

<p class="p2 center">STEVE GREEN’S STORY.</p>

<p>Steve Green was born in Tennessee in 1862.
He has never been to school a day, and has
worked for his living since childhood. He married
and settled in Arkansas, choosing a place
where there was good schooling for his children.
What befell him there is told in his own words:</p>

<p>“In 1910 the landlord, Mr. Saddler, raised the
rent from $5 an acre to $9. I and all of the
other tenants moved away. Mr. Saddler sent
after me, and said that if I did not work for
him I could not work in Crittenden County. I
moved to a place a mile away, but after the
death of my wife started to break up housekeeping.
Meantime I hired out for a day to a
neighbor, when Mr. Saddler rode by on his
horse. He said, ‘Green, didn’t I tell you that
if you didn’t work on my farm that there was
not room enough in Crittenden County for you
and me to live?’ I said, ‘Yes, sir; you told me
so.’ He answered, ‘I meant just what I said,’
and drew his revolver. I ran, but he shot me
in the neck, left arm and right leg. I kept on
running and reached my house, got my Winchester
and shot at him. They say that I killed him.
The others still chased me and I jumped into the
river. I stayed in the top of a tree until midnight.
Then I got some cartridges from a colored
man and went to a town some miles away,
which took me three nights to walk, wading in
creeks because of the bloodhounds. My friends
brought me food and blankets and I stayed on
an island in the Mississippi River three weeks.
Colored friends gave me $32, and I traveled
on foot and by rail to Chicago, arriving
August 12. I was betrayed by a colored friend
who told the police. The policeman arrested me,
saying that I had stolen some ties, which I
knew nothing about. He took me to the Harrison
street station. For four days they gave me
no food or drink. I ate two boxes of matches
trying to kill myself. They kept questioning me
about Arkansas. At last I look sick and they
put me in the hospital, where the doctor told
them I was starving, and they gave me something
to eat. Finally Saddler’s nephew came and I
was identified, and Sunday night we left for
Arkansas. He said a thousand people were waiting
to burn me. The colored people of Chicago
had heard of the story and got out a writ of
habeas corpus. They offered a reward of $100
to the sheriff who would reach me and telegraphed
all along the line to catch me. The
sheriff of Cairo got me just as we were nearing
the line. He is the man who replaced the former
sheriff—the one the Governor held responsible
for the mob in that city. I was stopped and
sent back to Chicago.”</p>

<p>Steve Green’s friends have engaged lawyers
and are fighting his case for him. The outcome
of their efforts to save this unfortunate man will
be recorded in <span class="smcap">The Crisis</span>.</p>

<p class="center">THE PINK FRANKLIN CASE.</p>

<p>Pink Franklin, a colored man, was charged
with breaking his labor contract. The labor
contract law of South Carolina says that a
farm laborer who leaves his job before the end
of the year owing his employer, is guilty of a
criminal offense and may be severely punished.
In the dead of night the constable broke into
Pink Franklin’s house, shot at him and wounded
him. Franklin could not see who was shooting
and had no means of knowing that it was an
officer of the law. He leapt from bed and
returned the fire, killing the constable.</p>

<p>He was arrested for murder, threatened with
lynching and condemned to be hanged. Two
colored lawyers defended him and appealed
finally to the Supreme Court of the United
States. The Supreme Court gave no relief and
Pink Franklin still lies under sentence of death.
Effort is now being made to induce the Governor
of South Carolina to reprieve him.</p>

<p>She was a well-educated, attractive colored
teacher.</p>

<p>“Some people,” she said, “think Charleston to
be the prettiest city in the Southland. The houses
are big and cool with lovely gardens. And then
there is a park. You ought to see it! I don’t
believe any park could be prettier.</p>

<p>“I have only seen it once,” she went on. “I
did want to visit that park before I left Charleston,
so I asked one of the while Northern ladies—we
were teaching in the same school—if she
would take me there. She was the right kind, and
we walked all through it. Of course every one
thought I was her maid. It certainly was a
pretty place.”</p>

<p>“But why should the colored people of
Charleston,” I asked, “be deprived of a public
place of recreation? Don’t they contribute to
the city by their work and rent and taxes?”</p>

<p>“They certainly do,” she replied, “but that
makes no difference. The park I visited is a
white folks’ park. It is very beautiful and so
they keep it to themselves. Do you know,” she
added, thoughtfully, “I don’t believe they would
be happy there among the trees and flowers if
they thought people who were poor and black
could get in.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A Chicago schoolboy, claiming that a twenty-five-cent
piece had been stolen from him, accused
the only colored boy in the class, who was suspended.
The quarter was subsequently found
where the owner had carelessly placed it and
forgotten it, but the teacher made no mention
of this. The colored boy’s mother came to
inquire into the matter after several days and
protested against the accusation. “You shouldn’t
mind so much,” said the teacher. “You know it
is a common saying that colored people are
dishonest.”</p>

<h4 class="h3head">The New York Negro as a Tenant</h4>

<div class="smaller">
<p>Every Negro resident of New York City prior to the year 1900 remembers too
well the great difficulty always experienced in trying to find anything like a decent place
to live. Never before this time was the question of “How much rent shall we pay?”
anything like as important as “Where can we live?”</p>

<p class="p0">The Negro as a tenant was wanted nowhere except in the very poorest section of
the city and there only in such houses as were so run down that even the poorest
of whites refused to longer occupy them. In these houses Negroes were crowded
together without any regard for their health or morals. Here they were bullied and
even insulted by independent landlords, who were very careful to do little or nothing
for their erstwhile not wanted tenants except to squeeze from them every dollar of
rent possible.</p>

<p class="p0">This was a “condition, not a theory,” that we faced when in October, 1900, we
opened our office as the first Negro Real Estate Agents in New York City, making a
specialty of the management of colored tenement property. Our very best friends all
told us that we were attempting the impossible, that we could not succeed, that we
would starve in our undertaking. For the first year and a half they proved to be
prophets indeed. Our many disappointments, heartaches and actual sufferings during
this period would fill a book and read like a romance. Every one could tell us how we
could NOT make it, but none how we could.</p>

<p class="p0">We were real estate agents making a specialty of the management of colored
tenement property for nearly a year before we actually succeeded in getting a colored
tenement to manage. Our first opportunity occurred in West 134th Street as a result
of a dispute between two landlords. To “get even” one of them turned his house over
to us to fill with colored tenants. We were so very successful in renting and managing
this house that, after a time, we were able to induce other landlords in whose houses
vacancies had occurred due to the opening of this house for colored people, to make
the change and give us their property to manage.</p>

<p class="p0">This was the beginning of the turning over to Negro tenants of one of the very
best sections of Manhattan Island and in no part of the city are there any better built
or more modern tenements for any class of people than are now occupied by Negroes
in this section. By opening for colored tenants first a house in one block, and then a
house in another, we have finally succeeded in securing for the colored people of New
York over 250 first-class flats and private dwellings in a fine section of the city, conveniently
located as to transportation facilities, etc.</p>

<p class="p0">To this extent our ambition has been gratified. There is, however, more work to
be done in another direction before we shall be entirely satisfied with the condition of
the Negro tenancy in this great city. We feel that our personal experience both as a
Negro tenant and a landlord has peculiarly fitted us for the work. Dr. Booker T.
Washington in his latest book, “The Negro in Business,” says: “<cite>Mr. Payton has had
an opportunity during this time to learn something of the condition under which colored
tenants live, sometimes are compelled to live, in New York. Stranger than all else, he
was, as he has confessed to me, several times put out of houses, bag and baggage, for
inability to pay his rent. He has thus been able to see how an ejectment suit looks
from both the point of view of tenant and of landlord.</cite>”</p>

<p class="p0">There is every reason why colored tenement property should be managed by Negro
agents. From them, the tenant may be certain of receiving more real interest, sympathy
and respect. Were the Negroes to demand it to-day, at least 90 per cent. of the
colored tenements in this city could be controlled by agents of their own race. This
would not only be of benefit to the tenant but to the entire race.</p>

<p class="p0">Tell your landlord that you prefer to have your rent collected by a Negro agent.
In this manner you will be aiding your people in their struggle for commercial advancement.
You owe it to your race to do this.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
